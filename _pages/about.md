I'm an upcoming graduate from the University of Western Ontario majoring in Computer Science. 

I love taking on and solving difficult challenges, building web/mobile applications, and building creative web tools. My goal is to develop my skills as a software developer and further expand my knowledge by learning and working with new technology.

Feel free to reach out to me!
