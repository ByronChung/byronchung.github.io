I'm an upcoming graduate from the University of Western Ontario majoring in Computer Science. 

I love taking on and solving difficult challenges and building web/mobile applications. My goal is to develop my skills as a software developer and further expand my knowledge by learning and working with new technology.

Feel free to reach out to me!
